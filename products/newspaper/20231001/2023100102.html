                    <span> The database of the Computer Intelligence Community had been hacked!<br>
                        X and F, are two engineers being good at examining the log to find out the root problem(s) so
                        the Command Center asked them to write the bug report but nothing was found! Command Center
                        asked them to upload the log as a response and they would read the log themselves. Soon they
                        gave up to do this kind of thing because it is too complex to read!</span>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        The idea of the passage is to show the complexity of the log file.<br>
                        The log file is a file that contains the information of the computer system.<br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>OK, let me think how should I tell you the truth.</mark>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Translation is not a simple work. <mark>You not only need to remember all the meaning of the
                            words, find the best way to translate to make it "beautiful", but also the names.</mark>
                        From Chinese to English, we usually just use <i>pinyin</i>, but it's not really the best way to
                        translate. It's good to translate the Chinese name into an available English word. The word
                        don't need to be very long, but it should be similar to the Chinese name in speaking. This can
                        make the translation more fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A great example is <i>Rogar</i>. <i>Rogar</i> is the name of a Chinese character. You can see
                        that this kinf of name is both similar to the original name and "beautiful". But, you know, the
                        translation is not always like y = x, it usually have many different ways to translate.
                        Recently, F has translated <i>Rogar</i> into <i>Yogurt</i>. Therefore, <mark>we don't need to be
                            so serious about the translation</mark>, so you can find a great translation in my passage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <mark>But pronounce is not the only way for you to translate the names.</mark> The first letter
                        of <i>pinyin</i> of all the characters is also a good way to translate the names. <i>YYY</i> is
                        also a good example. <i>YYY</i> is the name of a Chinese character and his name is <i>Y*n
                            Yu***n</i>. In this passage, you can also find some good examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Take the passage seriously and you can find something more than you thought.
